This is my work based on the [Complete 2020 Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning-bootcamp) courses in sections 6, 7, and 8. In this work, I learned to pre-process text data for the Naive Bayes classifier on the email spam filter.
